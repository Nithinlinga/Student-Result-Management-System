# Student-Result-Management-System
This project is mainly aimed to be developed for the administration, faculties and the students at the University. The administration is responsible for overseeing different areas of  the university, such as managing student marks and grades records and academic results. 
The Web-Based Result Management System is an all-encompassing solution created to answer the difficulties encountered in the customary university result administration process. With the use of their university credentials, students will be able to obtain their performance reports using this project's user friendly and effective web-based application. If they are dissatisfied with their grades, they may also seek corrections
The main purpose of developing this web-based result management system is to make it hassle free job for students to check their results on a dedicated website where they can just login using their university credentials and get the records of marks of subjects they have scored in particular subject in course they are enrolled in particular semester, and for administration it would be easier to just upload as well as update the result based on rectification requested by the student if required. This will help in automation of result generation and eliminate inconsistencies in student records
